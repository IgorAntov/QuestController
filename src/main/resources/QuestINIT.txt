Ensure VLC is Installed Correctly
First, make sure the 64-bit version of the VLC media player and its development libraries are installed on your system. If you installed VLC via a non-standard method (like a Snap package), your application might not find the libraries in the expected locations.
Install via your system's package manager:
bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems
sudo apt-get install vlc libvlc-dev

# For Fedora/CentOS-based systems
sudo dnf install vlc libvlc-devel
# or
sudo yum install vlc libvlc-devel
